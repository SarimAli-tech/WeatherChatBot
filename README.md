# Weather Chatbot using Dialogflow and .NET C#

This is an intelligent chatbot that provides real-time weather updates based on user queries. It is built using **Google Dialogflow** as the NLP engine and **.NET C#** as the backend webhook. The chatbot integrates with the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch live weather data based on user location inputs.

## üí° Features

- Understands natural language queries like:
  - "What's the weather in Karachi?"
  - "Tell me the temperature in London."
- Fetches real-time weather using OpenWeatherMap API
- NLP-based intent recognition using Google Dialogflow
- Backend implemented in ASP.NET Web API (C#)
- JSON parsing and structured response messages
